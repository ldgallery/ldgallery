# NAME

ldgallery viewer - a static web gallery viewer with tags


# DESCRIPTION

The ldgallery viewer is a web application that allows users to browse, search through and view items in galleries generated by the ldgallery(1) compiler.

The web application runs in a JavaScript-enabled web browser and does not require any special software on the server's side.
Its responsiveness allows it to be used from either a desktop browser or some mobile device.


# USER INTERFACE

The viewer's user interface is split into a main item view and a side search panel, which can be opened by using the appropriate button in the toolbar at the top-left corner.

The main view displays the gallery's directories and items as a thumbnail grid.

The side panel allows the user to interactively enter filtering queries to search through the gallery's content.
This panel features a list of relevant tags, grouped by categories, that can be used to build the search query.

Picture items can be opened and visualised within the application.
Other types of elements are either downloaded or displayed in the same window depending on the user's web browser supported media types.


# SEARCH QUERIES

Items can be filtered based on their tags.
Adding tags to the search query restricts the search results to items having those tags.
Tags which belong to multiple categories may be disambiguated by adding their category as a prefix, separated by a colon (":").

The following modifiers can be used in queries as prefixes of tags:

`+`
: Include all items having the associated tag, independently of simple tag restrictions.

`-`
: Exclude all items having the associated tag, independently of simple tag restrictions and inclusions.

Autocompletion suggestions are shown as filters are being typed in the query field.
In the case of disambiguated tags, both the category and the tag components are allowed to be partially entered, allowing "loc:fra" to expand into "location:france" for example.


# VIEWER CONFIGURATION

The viewer itself can be configured through a JSON file named "config.json" and placed in the web viewer's directory.

galleryRoot
: Absolute or relative path to the root of the gallery to display.


# PROGRESSIVE WEB APPLICATION

This web application can be "installed" on some user's mobile device as a progressive web application, i.e. a shortcut giving the web page the appearance of a native application.

This feature can be enabled by adding a PWA manifest in the viewer's directory when deployed.
An example of such manifest and an associated icon are available in the example folder packaged with the viewer.
